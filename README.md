The splendor before my eyes left me breathless, a vaulted ceiling painted with scenes from an ancient tale; tapestries that stretched across three walls depicting tales of heroes long dead.
However, as fate would have it, I was thoroughly distracted by the flurry of magic explosions obliterating my vision every time a magic spell hit its target: the dragon. After all, I was a mere human in the company of two magical beings, my companion Galena, a witch, and a fearsome crystal dragon. My presence here was not only an honor but also a grave danger.
"You know what to do, right?!" Galena shouted at me as she threw another fireball at the dragon's head.
I had been tasked with assisting Galena on this quest to save the world from the evil of a dragon. But how could I possibly help?



You run away from the Dragon, leaving Galena alone.
No! I couldn't just leave Galena behind and run off. But what could I do?
You're searching for a stronger adventure to help us.
"Help!" you shout at the top of your lungs, hoping that someone, somewhere, will hear you and come to your rescue.
"Hey, you! What are you doing?" asks a woman standing nearby.
You ehxausted you say for her "PLEASE, HELP!!! My friend is fighting against a powerful dragon!"
She looks at you with pity a moment, then shakes her head.
"Why did you bring us into this mess?"
The woman turns and walks away.
I can't blame her. I'm sure she's had her fair share of crazy people.
"Galena, wait!" I shout, trying to get her attention.
You in fear you brand your sword and jumping on the dragon, you swing your swrod upon him.
The dragon roars and snaps its jaws, trying to bite you in half. But your reflexes are faster and you jump to safety.
As the dragon tries to regain its balance, you take advantage of the opportunity to attack again.
You with a single blow, you cut the dragon's wings.
You manage to cut off the dragon's wings and it tumbles forward, crashing into the ground.
The dragon groans in pain and struggles to stand back up., while you swing you scream "PLEASE STOP!!"
I close my eyes and let out a deep, guttural scream.
You ask "Are you ok Galena?!"
I look over at Galena, who has managed to stay alive somehow. She nods slowly and smiles.
You ask "Are you really Galena?"
"Who else could I be, silly?" she says, laughing.
"I don't know. Maybe you're a doppelganger. Or maybe you're just an evil clone of Galena," I reply, trying to make sense of what's going on.
